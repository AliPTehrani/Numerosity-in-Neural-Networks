# Numerosity-in-Neural-Networks
This is the project for my Bachelor Theis : "Do convolutional neural networks encode numerosity information?"
It is used to explore the "number sense" of the convolutional neural networks: Alexnet, VGG-Net, Resnet and CORnet.
The models will be analyzed with multiple regression to detect number sensitivity and are afterwards compared to real brain data from fmRI scans.
